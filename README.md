# AutoTrafficControl
An automatic traffic signal management system designed to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion. This project uses sensors, timers, and real-time data processing to adapt signal durations dynamically based on vehicle density at intersections. It aims to create a smarter and more efficient urban traffic management solution.
